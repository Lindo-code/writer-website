              <i>Defined in the dictionary as works of fiction that are shorter than a novel.</i> <br><br>

              I've always been fascinated by fiction, especially by how much of it can be seen as fact and how much as fabrication, you always walk a thin line between the two when attempting to write good fiction. It's like trying to be a good liar; tell too much facts and risk revealing the entire truth, yet if you add too much fabrication you risk making your lie too obvious, the key is in finding an equlibrium between the two. So below I make an effort at weaving good lies, and I start small. - Sdrow Vieli Â©

              A shuffle of feet sounded at the door, heart beating at a sprinters pace Akash darted his eyes towards it, the door was blocked by a large wooden wardrobe which leaned against it, Akash had hauled the thing from the far side of the small room,  and now it sagged diagonally, doors wide open and the inside not only stuffed with clothing; but a kettle, a double plate stove, pots, pans and almost anything he had found. <br>
              The hammering in his chest was accompanied by a pin pricking sensation creeping up his back. Akash leaned his head tentatively towards the door, listening for the sound he'd just heard. Only silence greeted him, no familiar screams of joy from children at play, no sounds of loud yet unintelligible conversations followed by laughter, and no music, there was always someone playing music, but today it was quiet, and the silence felt eerie, yet it reassured him. No one was at the door. The tension he felt and his wayward mind were getting the better of him, letting out a breath Akash relaxed a fraction, they hadn't found him, not yet.

              NEW NEIGHBOURS <br><br>

              Mama gripped a chicken by its clawed and wrinkled feet, headless over a yellow bucket, with blood dripping; thick and red from where its head had been, ruffled feathers littered the ground and stuck around the rim of the bucket, slick and shiny. There was that musty smell that came when you dipped a bird in warm water, and mama looked like a sangoma; her hands covered in blood and tufts of feathers clinging to them. The chicken still fought in her grip, bucking and twisting like a rabid dog on a leash, but its efforts were futile; mamas hands held it with the steady calm of someone who'd done this many times, someone who knew it would be over soon, one hand wrapped around the birds bloody, headless neck, the other around its wings; mashing them together behind its back. <br>
              I'd seen this happen countless times, the moment its kicking and wrenching became weaker, less frantic, until it ticked down to little jerks that were moments apart, then small twitches, each making me wonder if it was its last. Unlike me mama always knew; because when she tossed it back into the bucket, the bird just flopped, as lifeless and motionless as a rag doll. She lifted the urn beside her and emptied the hot water into the bucket, its steam curling and twisting, then she put the urn back down with a soft clang...

              Why Not? <br><br>

              Fortyfive kilometres south-east of the Limpopo capital of Polokwane is Lebowakgomo, and beyond that, to be more specific, about ten kilometres south-east of that is a small village; where red and copper sands cover the land, a rural place with more gravel than tarmac strewn over its roads; where old, lumbering taxis ferry passengers; their tyres dipping in and out of potholes and not only leaving a curtain of dust in their wake, but the unmelodious clatter of metal ringing in your ears. <br> 
              Valentia sat at the back seat of one of those taxis, the window on her side open and a timid wind brushing against her face. She watched clusters of yellow tinged green grass slide past, only to make way for more, amongst the grass grew a scattering of pale-green shrubs, and trees with branches that twisted in every direction; everything here seemed hard, accustomed to the harsh sun. From time to time the taxi would go past houses, broken down things, without windows or doors, just openings abandoned. <br>
              The man sitting beside her shifted in his seat, when Valentia glanced at him; his lips parted, revealing rows of yellow stained teeth, then he turned and looked ahead. The man wore a brown short sleeved shirt, and blue shorts which had clearly been long trousers before he'd sheared them off with a pair of scissors. A large, red plastic bag was perched on his lap overlapping into her space, its sharp edge stabbing at her thigh each time the taxi sank in and out of a pothole, or bounced on uneven ground.
